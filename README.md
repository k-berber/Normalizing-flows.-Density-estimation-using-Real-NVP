# Normalizing-flows.-Density-estimation-using-Real-NVP
Normalizing flows is the class of probabilistic models that provides flexible parametrical probabilistic models, where the probability density function can be computed exactly. In the assignment, we will consider a real-valued non-volume preserving normalizing flows (Real NVP) -- a special case of normalizing flow. Our goal is to train a generative network  𝑔𝜃:𝑍→𝑋,𝑔=𝑓^−1  that maps latent variable  𝑧∼𝑝(𝑧)  to a sample  𝑥∼𝑝(𝑥) . Where  𝑝(𝑧)  is a prior distibiution and  𝑝(𝑥)  is a data distibution. An illustrative example is provided below.
